           <h1>About Me</h1>
           <p>Hello! I am Ryan and I love computers and coding. I started with computers when I was young which gives me a slight advantage in the long run. I'd like to think that I am pretty good at what I do for my age. I am not going to go out and set up a server with form submissions and things. I am the guy that you contact to do the website and strictly that. I know a lot about HTML and working on my CSS skils.</p>
           <p>Recently I have been taking a Code Acadamy Course online. I am doing to get a refresh in HTML and start in CSS. I also get my work done pretty quickly this site (as of 4.2.2018) has taken me about 5 hours to make. I enjoy what I do which helps me get what I need done quicker.</p>
