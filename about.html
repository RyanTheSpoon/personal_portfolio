            <center><p>Hello! I am Ryan and I love computers and coding. I started with computers when I was young which gives me a slight advantage in the long run. I'd like to think that I am pretty good at what I do for my age. I am not going to go out and set up a server with form submissions and things. I am the guy that you contact to do the website and strictly that. I know a lot about HTML and working on my CSS skils.</p></center>
            <center><p>Recently I have been taking a Code Acadamy Course online. I am doing to get a refresh in HTML and start in CSS. </p></center>
