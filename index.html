            <center><h1>I Am Ryan West</h1></center>
            <center><p>Hello! I am Ryan and I love computers and coding. I started with computers when I was young which gives me a slight advantage in the long run. I'd like to think that I am pretty good at what I do for my age. I am not going to go out and set up a server with form submissions and things. I am the guy that you contact to do the website and strictly that. I know a lot about HTML and working on my CSS skils.<a href="about.html">For More.</a></p></center>

            <center><h2>Why Do You Need A Website?</h2></center>
            <center>You need a website so you can get your project, product, or opinions out there. You also need one so whatever demographic you are trying to reach you can so it in a portable and more effiecient way. Chances are whoever you are trying to reach will have access to internet. This could save you money on paper, ink, and printer matinence costs. Also, unlike you your website runs 24/7, so nomattter what time or day it is your demographic can access your oneline "brochure". You can also look at what kind of people look at you website.</center>
